# dondesudar

DondeSudar was my final project of DAW. A 2 years degree I ended in 2013.
It's made with raw PHP (MVC rulz, but no frameworks on server side), JQuery and Bootstrap.
And it's a gyms search and valoration website. Like filmaffinity does with movies or tripadvisor with a lot of things.

I just uploaded the code to avoid loose it.

I have no idea where the SQL script for create the DB is. But I will try to find it and upload it.
